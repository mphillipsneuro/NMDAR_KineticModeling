Software for performing kinetic simulations of NMDA receptor kinetics, and fitting simulations to data, using python and NEURON. 

Requires installation of a Python distribution (Anaconda recommended) and NEURON

Start with "Tutorial" file for walkthrough.

Note: while designed for NMDA receptors, this should work with any ion channel model that uses .SCOP or .MOD model files. Can be used as a replacement for the now-defunct SCoP program.
